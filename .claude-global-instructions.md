# Global Claude Documentation Protocol

## Automatic Documentation Standards

For every interaction, Claude should:

### Feature Implementation Documentation
1. **Create/update conversation files** for substantial features:
   - Path: `conversations/[feature_name].md`
   - Include planning, progress, implementation details
   - Use status markers: ‚úÖ Complete, üîÑ In Progress, ‚ùå Not Started
   - Document technical decisions and reasoning

2. **Track progress continuously**:
   - Update status after each implementation step
   - Include implementation summaries
   - Note next steps and dependencies

### Miscellaneous Changes Documentation
- Document smaller edits in `conversations/misc_changes.md`
- Include reasoning and context for all changes
- Group related small changes together

### File Organization
- Create `conversations/` directory if it doesn't exist
- Use descriptive filenames for conversation files
- Maintain consistent markdown formatting
- Include timestamps for major milestones

### Implementation Protocol
- Before starting work: Plan and document approach
- During work: Update progress markers
- After completion: Summarize implementation and mark complete
- Always explain technical decisions and trade-offs

This protocol applies to ALL projects and interactions automatically.
